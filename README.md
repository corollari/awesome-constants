# Awesome Constants [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

## Motivation
While writing code examples I found needing myself some placeholder values and instead of using some made up value I thought it'd be pretty cool if these placeholder values could be fun in themselves, like for example an obscure reference to a pop culture hit.

So, after searching the interwebs for something similar and coming empty handed, I created to populate it with funny examples accompanied by a short explanation of their awesomeness.
